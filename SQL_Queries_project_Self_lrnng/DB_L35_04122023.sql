--Difference in  Where and Having 

-- having is used to make condition on table and group-- in short without group there is no having
-- means agar group by nahi hai to having bhi nahi hoga kyo ki having to condition group pe lagata hai.
-- Where is used to put condition on table -- In short without table there is no where

-- with aggregate function
-- without aggregate function


-- There are 4 types of table also--
-- 1. Permanent, Derived, Magic, temporary
-- with aggregate functionn by using derived table
select min(salary) as Third_Highest_Salary from
(select  top(3) salary from Employee order by salary desc)ABC  -- This ABC table is called derived table because we assume it not create it so we can apply only some limited function on it.

-- without using aggregate functions
select * from
(select top(3) salary from Employee order by salary desc) Derived_table order by salary asc  -- Derived table is in descending order


-- Third Highest salary without using aggregate function.

select top(1) salary as Third_Highest_Salary from
(select top(3) salary from Employee order by salary desc) Derived_table order by salary asc

select top(1) salary from 
(select top(3) salary from Employee order by salary desc) ABC order by salary asc
